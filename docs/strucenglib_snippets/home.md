The {StrucEng} Library is a open source framework for Finite Element Analysis (FEA)â€¦ It offers a variety of material models (linear elastic, ideally plastic, non-line), AI-based analysis tools, load generators, safety concepts and graphical evaluation tools, and various enhancements (connection to HPC, user interfaces, etc.). Currently, the library only supports Ansys Mechanical APDL as backend and Rhinoceros as frontend. The package builds upon COMPAS and COMPAS FEA, an open-source Python-based framework for collaboration and research in architecture, engineering and digital fabrication.



Note

COMPAS_SLICER is still in a very early, pre-release state and therefore could contain bugs. In case you find bugs or would like to request additional functionality, please submit an issue using the Issue Tracker.
